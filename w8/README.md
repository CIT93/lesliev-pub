# My Understanding

- i understand the appendChild and how it adds new nodes in the parent one
- const declares variables and does not let the variables id be changed
- it can hold and obj and array and modify both
- the const table fucntions like tr, td, thead all render the table with the createElement
- console.log outputs values to dev tools console
- event listener kind of waits for a specific element or input to execute a function
- i understand the conecpets on importing and exporting but i forgot the actual name o it

## info & feedback
- i know it wasn't really focused on devtools but this video kind of helped me understand that a bit more
- while i use devtools to see my code and console, i dont mess with breakpoints but with this video it made setting breakpoints easy

## code challenge
- i was able to get table rows with the variables before but as a obj array
- when i did this method however, the buttons would end up in a row below and i couldnt find a way to fix it
- i referenced the carbon fp information since i remember we did if statements there
- because these are not numbers, im mot sure what variables to put
- i keep getting error in a TBL append child 

## code challenge 2
- i tried adding the append child td and i keep getting an error
- going throught the video, i might have forgotten to reference tr
- i got most of the build it td content right but i messed up with td instead of tr

## how we handle the edit
- i think the edit button would be handled with an event listener that lets the user edit the row data. After doing research, it seems object keys might be a good way to go about making the edit button. i think there would be more code added to what i did but thats what i could come up with. i did get working code but it doesnt seem to do anything
