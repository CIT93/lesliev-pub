## Challenge
- i didnt need to update code 
- my code no longer runs however so i think i might have moved something around
- glad you brought up the cfp data thing because that was making my code not work
- i do still have a thing going on in my code
- when i input data for the table, the table does come up but with the numbers and names in different columns, i dont remember if this was because it was a req in a previous code along that shifted some columns around
- the carbon footprint number is also always zero unless i put a number and house size in the first and last name inputs

## Feedback
- your explanation did help me understand a bit more since it clarified functions and return values
- default value
- spread operator lets us take elments from an array/object and psread them out using (...)
- IIFE are functions that run as soon as defined
- they create new scopes so global scope isnt cluttered
- any variables inside cant be referenced outisde
- inner function can read outisde
- inner and outer functions could be seen as global and block scope
