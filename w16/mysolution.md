# Water Consumption - My Solution

- for the first part, i would be like how the rest of the cfp data was made 
- the way im thinking of doing it may not be the best but im thinking add the drop down select for the washer/dryer and then after inputting, have a question asking whether you own both
- the question would have have buttons where you can click your answer, if NO then it would give you the total up until that point, if YES it would run the calc twice (idk if by run twice it means to just double it or actually input a second time)
- i leaning towards it being having to input it twice, so if yes is picked it would let you input it again
- an event listener would probably be used for all this
